Tusi Sites,"<p>Located in the mountainous areas of south-west China, this property encompasses remains of several tribal domains whose chiefs were appointed by the central government as ‚ÄòTusi‚Äô, hereditary rulers from the 13<sup>th</sup> to the early 20<sup>th</sup>century. The Tusi system arose from the ethnic minorities‚Äô dynastic systems of government dating back to the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE. Its purpose was to unify national administration, while allowing ethnic minorities to retain their customs and way of life. The sites of Laosicheng, Tangya and Hailongtun Fortress that make up the site bear exceptional testimony to this form of governance, which derived from the Chinese civilization of the Yuan and Ming periods.</p>",109.9669444,28.99861111,China,Asia and the Pacific
"Christiansfeld, a Moravian Church Settlement","<p>Founded in 1773 in South Jutland, the site is an example of a planned settlement of the Moravian Church, a Lutheran free congregation centred in Herrnhut, Saxony. The town was planned to represent the Protestant urban ideal, constructed around a central Church square. The architecture is homogenous and unadorned, with one and two-storey buildings in yellow brick with red tile roofs. The democratic organization of the Moravian Church, with its pioneering egalitarian philosophy, is expressed in its humanistic town planning. The settlement‚Äôs plan opens onto agricultural land and includes important buildings for the common welfare such as large communal houses for the congregation‚Äôs widows and unmarried men and women. The buildings are still in use and many are still owned by the local Moravian Church community .</p>",9.481388889,55.35555556,Denmark,Europe and North America
The par force hunting landscape in North Zealand,"<p>Located about 30 km northeast of Copenhagen, this cultural landscape encompasses the two hunting forests of Store Dyrehave and Gribskov, as well as the hunting park of J√¶gersborg Hegn/J√¶gersborg Dyrehave. This is a designed landscape where Danish kings and their court practiced¬†par force hunting, or hunting with hounds, which reached its peak between the 17th and the late 18th centuries, when the absloute monarchs transformed it into a landscape of power. With hunting lanes laid out in a star system, combined with an orthogonal grid pattern, numbered stone posts, fences¬†and a hunting lodge, the site demonstrates the application of Baroque landscaping principles to forested areas.</p>",12.35777778,55.91361111,Denmark,Europe and North America
"The Climats, terroirs of Burgundy","<p>The climates are precisely delimited vineyard parcels on the slopes of the C√¥te de Nuits and the C√¥te de Beaune south of the city of Dijon. They differ from one another due to specific natural conditions (geology and exposure) as well as vine types and have been shaped by human cultivation. Over time they came to be recognized by the wine they produce. This cultural landscape consists of two parts. Firstly, the vineyards and associated production units including villages and the town of Beaune, which together represent the commercial dimension of the production system. The second part includes the historic centre of Dijon, which embodies the political regulatory impetus that gave birth to the climats system. The site is an outstanding example of grape cultivation and wine production developed since the High Middle Ages.</p>",4.864444444,47.05805556,France,Europe and North America
"Champagne Hillsides, Houses and Cellars","<p><span>The property encompasses sites where the method of producing sparkling wines was developed on the principle of secondary fermentation in the bottle since the early 17</span><sup>th</sup><span> century to its early industrialization in the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century. The property is made up of three distinct ensembles: the historic vineyards of Hautvillers, A√ø and Mareuil-sur-A√ø, Saint-Nicaise Hill in Reims, and the Avenue de Champagne and Fort Chabrol in Epernay. These three components ‚Äì the supply basin formed by the historic hillsides, the production sites (with their underground cellars) and the sales and distribution centres (the Champagne Houses) - illustrate the entire champagne production process. The property bears clear testimony to the development of a very specialized artisan activity that has become an agro-industrial enterprise.</span></p>",3.946111111,49.0775,France,Europe and North America
Speicherstadt and Kontorhaus District with Chilehaus,"<p>Speicherstadt and the adjacent Kontorhaus district are two densely built urban areas in the centre of the port city of Hamburg. Speicherstadt, originally developed on a group of narrow islands in the Elbe River between 1885 and 1927, was partly rebuilt from 1949 to 1967. It is one of the largest coherent historic ensembles of port warehouses in the world (300,000 m<sup>2</sup>). It includes 15 very large warehouse blocks as well as six ancillary buildings and a connecting network of short canals. Adjacent to the modernist Chilehaus office building, the Kontorhaus district is an area of over five hectares featuring six very large office complexes built from the 1920s to the 1940s to house port-related businesses. The complex exemplifies the effects of the rapid growth in international trade in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>",9.999444444,53.54555556,Germany,Europe and North America
